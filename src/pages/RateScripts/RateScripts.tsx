      <p>
        This is a library of RATES blocks in BASIC language for the USGS
        geochemical modeling program ᴘʜʀᴇᴇǫᴄ. About 100 minerals and phases are
        included in this library. For documentation and citation, users should
        consult and refer to the article:

        A companion PHASES block library that is needed to use the RATES scripts
        is also provided. Both RATES and PHASES blocks are included in datasets,
        phreeqc-kinetics.dat, diagenesis.dat, and geothermal.dat options for
        online ᴘʜʀᴇᴇǫᴄ. If you just need to know the value of reaction rates at
        a temperature and pH of your interest, you can use the{" "}
        <a className="App-links__item" href={ROUTES.RATE_CALCULATOR}>
          rate calculator
        </a>
        . All phases in the library are included in the calculator.
